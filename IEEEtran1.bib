abstract={This paper compares the performance of conventional adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) network and extreme-ANFIS on regression problems. ANFIS networks incorporate the explicit knowledge of the fuzzy systems and learning capabilities of neural networks. The proposed new learning technique overcomes the slow learning speed of the conventional learning techniques like neural networks and support vector machines (SVM) without sacrificing the generalization capability. The structure of extreme-ANFIS network is similar to the conventional ANFIS which combines the fuzzy logic's qualitative approach and neural network's adaptive capability. As in the case of extreme learning machines (ELM), the first layer parameters of the proposed learning machine are not tuned. Performance on two regression problems shows that extreme-ANFIS provides better generalization capability and faster learning speed.},

The new learning machine combines the learning capabilities of neural networks and the explicit knowledge of the fuzzy systems as in the case of conventional adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The parameters of the fuzzy layer of ELANFIS are not tuned to achieve faster learning speed without sacrificing the generalization capability. The proposed learning machine is used for inverse control and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Simulation results show improved performance with very less computation time which is much essential for real time control.},

abstract={FC is a clean energy source alternative for electric vehicle and certain microgrid operations. However to compensate its slow dynamics and inability for tracking fast load transients it needs some auxiliary storage system like battery, supercapacitor (SC) or ultracapacitor (UC). This paper considers hybrid combination of FC-UC, as it has added advantages over other storage systems like instantaneous charging and discharging with increased lifetime of fuel cell. Furthermore, the paper proposes the dynamic model prediction based control strategy to achieve optimum current management. To optimize control efforts and computation complexity of optimization problem, the control strategy is used in two levels. The model predictive control (MPC) is used as outer control loop which provides optimal current references to the inner control loop which is designed using PI controller. The proposed control strategy is simulated and validated using MATLAB/ SIMULINK.},

Here, we consider a non-linear, nonholonomic and highly under-actuated dynamical model of AUV with six degrees of freedom. Because of its higher-dimensional complex model, the traditional model predictive control technique leads to computational complexity and loss of controllability. The paper proposes a novel MPC scheme using reduced dynamical model. In which, the MPC problem to control AUV in vertical and horizontal planes is formulated as independent optimization problems. The proposed scheme reduces higher-dimensional model to two independent time-varying linearized models for controlling motion in vertical and horizontal planes by neglecting weakly coupled dynamics. Further the reduced optimization problem is solved using quadratic programming to achieve trade-off between computational complexity and control effort optimization. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme which is employed on non-linear model."

Thus to contribute towards scalability of these techniques, in this paper we propose a compositional abstraction-based synthesis for cascade interconnected discrete-time control systems. Given a cascade interconnection of several components, we provide results on the compositional construction of finite abstractions based on the notion of approximate cascade composition. Then, we provide a compositional controller synthesis for cascade interconnection. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the results using a numerical example and compare it with different abstraction and controller synthesis schemes."

abstract="In this paper, we introduce QUEST, a new tool for automated controller synthesis of incrementally input-to-state stable nonlinear control systems. This tool accepts ordinary differential equations as the descriptions of the nonlinear control systems and constructs their symbolic models using state-space quantization-free approach which can potentially alleviate the issue of so-called curse of dimensionality while computing discrete abstractions of the systems with high-dimensional state-space. The tool supports computation of both minimal and maximal fixed points and thus provides natively algorithms to synthesize controllers enforcing safety and reachability specifications. All the computations are done in C++. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the tool on a 10-room building temperature control. The tool together with user manual and some examples are available for download at www.hcs.ei.tum.de/software.",

abstract="This paper presents a methodology for temporal logic verification of discrete-time stochastic systems. Our goal is to find a lower bound on the probability that a complex temporal property is satisfied by finite traces of the system. Desired temporal properties of the system are expressed using a fragment of linear temporal logic, called safe LTL over finite traces. We propose to use barrier certificates for computations of such lower bounds, which is computationally much more efficient than the existing discretization-based approaches. The new approach is discretization-free and does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality caused by discretizing state sets. The proposed approach relies on decomposing the negation of the specification into a union of sequential reachabilities and then using barrier certificates to compute upper bounds for these reachability probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on case studies with linear and polynomial dynamics.",
